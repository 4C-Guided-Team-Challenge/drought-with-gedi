<b> Overview </b>

The sustained functioning of forest ecosystems is critical to achieving global climate and biodiversity goals but the resilience of forests to the intensifying threat of climate change is poorly understood. In particular, severe droughts such as those experienced across Amazonia in 2005, 2010 & 2016 may well have killed millions of trees, with drought increasing the risk of mortality for tree species adapted to wet conditions. Forests that experience periods of low rainfall, such as seasonally dry tropical forests, are well adapted to these conditions with a greater occurrence of deciduousness and shorter canopy, however similar adaptions are debated in moist tropical forests. 
Traditional optical remote sensing techniques detect changes in canopy greenness via Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI), but these may be affected by optical artifacts and do not pick up reliable signals of canopy height and structure. GEDI, a space-borne lidar instrument, fills that gap with billions of forest structure measurements taken from the International Space Station. 

<b> Goals </b>

In this project, we will first use GEDI data to examine forest structural differences across longstanding climatic and seasonal water gradients in the Amazon basin. We will build on these results to evaluate the resilience of differently adapted forests to anomalous drought conditions. If there is time, we will have the opportunity to investigate other factors that mediate forest resilience, including proximity to roads and rivers and other environmental conditions. 

<b> Directory Structure </b>

All the core code for the project resides in the drought folder, with any data that is accessed being stored in the data folder. Important figures and results can be found in the reports folder.
